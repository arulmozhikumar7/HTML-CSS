## Objective
Create a single-page website using semantic HTML elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>`.

## Requirements
- Apply basic CSS styling for typography and colors.
- Use CSS for spacing (margins and paddings) to create a clear structure.
- Implement a simple responsive design that adjusts the layout on smaller screens using media queries.

## Implementation Details

- The `<nav>` element includes links to different sections of the page.
- The `<main>` section contains the main content.
- The `<footer>` includes copyright information.
- A new section with ten buttons linking to different task pages (Task 1 to Task 10) has been added.

### CSS Styling
- Basic styling applied for colors, font, and spacing.
- Navigation links styled with white text on a dark background.
- Responsive design ensures proper spacing on smaller screens.
